##  Summary

In this code review, I cover the artifacts that I have chosen to enhance for the SNHU portfolio. I discuss the technologies and design patterns used to develop the artifacts, and my plans to enhance the projects in order to meet the designated outcomes of the degree.

This review demonstrates my ability to communicate about the underlying technologies in my projects, and meets one of the designated outcomes:

**Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts**

### [Artifact 1 - Software Engineering and Design](/portfolio/artifact1)
#### Travlr Full Stack Web Application

The Travlr App is a full stack web application I developed using a MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js). It is a travel booking application that allows users to search for trip packages to book flights and hotels. For this enhancement, I added new API methods and login capabilities for the client-facing Express site.

### [Artifact 2 - Algorithms and Data Structures](/portfolio/artifact2)
#### Hash Table Implementation for ABCU Advising

The hash table implementation for ABSU Advising was a C++ program meant to organize course data by hashing course numbers and storing course prerequisite data into nodes. The program allows users to search for courses and see the prerequisites needed to take the course. For this enhancement, I ported the program to the Rust programming language for safer memory management.

### [Artifact 3 - Databases](/portfolio/artifact3)
#### myStock Inventory Mobile Application

The myStock inventory mobile application was designed in Android Studio with Java to allow users to track inventory levels for products in their inventory whether it is a warehouse or other business. For this enhancement, I redesigned the database as it was not securely implemented and I added a data visualization activity and history activity.
