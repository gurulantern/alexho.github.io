## Background

At the beginning of this year, I wanted to start putting more time into game development. I had always wanted to make a game using Godot especially after the crazy Unity debacle where they changed a few of their policies concerning installation fees. I can't really remember but I do remember hearing about a few studios deliberately announcing that they would rather port ALL of their work over to Godot instead of paying Unity anymore than they deserved. Wild. 

Godot has all the boxes ticked for me. Open source box, great community box, a layout similar to Unity box, free box, and funny little robot man box. Sounds great. Sign me up. 

It has GDScript. It uses a Node-based structure for its projects. It's blue. I don't know, seems all right.

There is a wealth of tutorials out there too. Construct 3 had some tutorials but not nearly as helpful as some of the videos for Godot. I don't know how these people do it. They are the backbone of hobbyist game developers. Bless them.

I chose to follow a series about making a [Vampire Survivors clone](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtosjGHWDab682nfZ1f6JSQ1cjap7Ieeb). 

I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to jump into Godot. If you run into any issues, which you most likely will as there have been updates and changes to Godot since the publishing of this tutorial, the comments section often has people who have gone through your same issue and posted their solutions. Thank you, Branno, wherever you are!

I decided to create my own assets for it so I could practice my pixel art. The ideas started pumping and I wanted to put a spin on the Vampire Survivor's formula. To make my version a bit more unique, I based it on my partner, Hee Soo. Anytime I find myself cackling like a madman at the computer when I'm making games, I know I am in the flow state. There were a lot of moments like that for this game. 

I had to pause development on it because I was finishing up school, started working on Abu Simbel and went to Japan (post to come).
